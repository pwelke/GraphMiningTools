Outerplanarity test executable for Fabian.

usage: outerplanaritytest DATAFILE

Outputs JSON, one object per graph, to stdout.

Format:

{"graph": int, "hamiltonianCycles": List[List[int]], "isOuterplanar":Boolean}

hamiltonianCycles gives node ids in the original graph, in order, but with arbitrary starting point.
Node indexing starts with one and graphs are expected to have no missing node ids.

Note that even if some graph is not outerplanar, the list of HamiltonianCycles of blocks may not be empty.
It may contain HamiltonCycles of outerplanar blocks.
